## Abstract
In this paper, we propose NFCStack, which is a physical building block system that supports stacking and frictionless interaction and is based on near-field communication (NFC). This system con- sists of a portable station that can support and resolve the order of three types of passive identifiable stackable: bricks, boxes, and adapters. The bricks support stable and sturdy physical construc- tion, whereas the boxes support frictionless tangible interactions. The adapters provide an interface between the aforementioned two types of stackable and convert the top of a stack into a terminal for detecting interactions between NFC-tagged objects. In contrast to existing systems based on NFC or radio-frequency identification technologies, NFCStack is portable, supports simultaneous inter- actions, and resolves stacking and interaction events responsively, even when objects are not strictly aligned. Evaluation results in- dicate that the proposed system effectively supports 12 layers of rich-ID stacking with the three types of building block, even if every box is stacked with a 6-mm offset. The results also indicate possible generalized applications of the proposed system, including 2.5-dimensional construction. The interaction styles are described using several educational application examples, and the design implications of this research are explained.
